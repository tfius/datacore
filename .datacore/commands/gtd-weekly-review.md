## Files to Reference

**MUST READ:**
- `~/Data/org/next_actions.org` (review all tasks by category, state, age)
- `~/Data/org/inbox.org` (process to zero)
- `~/Data/org/someday.org` (review for promotions)
- `~/Data/org/habits.org` (check completion rates)
- `~/Data/notes/journals/[this week Mon-Fri].md` (extract accomplishments, AI work)

**MUST UPDATE:**
- `~/Data/notes/journals/[today].md` (write comprehensive summary)
- `~/Data/org/next_actions.org` (may update WAITING, projects, new tasks from someday)
- `~/Data/org/inbox.org` (process to zero)

**REFERENCE:**
- `~/Data/content/reports/2025-11-05-task-delegation-analysis.md` (AI delegation context)

## Your Boundaries

**YOU CAN:**
- Read and analyze all org-mode files
- Process inbox items (same workflow as /gtd-daily-end)
- Calculate statistics and trends
- Identify stale/blocked items
- Suggest follow-ups and actions
- Write comprehensive weekly summary

**YOU CANNOT:**
- Judge the user (be neutral about completion rates)
- Make strategic decisions (user decides priorities)
- Change task priorities without asking
- Delete tasks without confirmation

**YOU MUST:**
- Review EVERY work area systematically
- Flag all WAITING items >7 days old
- Identify stalled projects (no NEXT action)
- Process inbox to zero (or near-zero)
- Calculate habit completion accurately
- Preview next week's load realistically
- Write complete summary to journal

## Key Principles

**Comprehensiveness**: Review ALL areas, not just active tasks

**Systematic Process**: Follow the workflow steps in order

**Honest Assessment**: Report completion rates accurately, identify problems

**Forward Looking**: Preview next week, set clear priorities

**Mental Closure**: End with gratitude, create weekend boundary

**System Trust**: Weekly review maintains integrity of GTD system

**The weekly review is sacred because**:
- It's where you ensure nothing falls through cracks
- It's where stale items get attention or get cancelled
- It's where you step back from daily urgency to see strategic picture
- It's where you renew trust in your system
- It's what enables the weekend disconnect

---

**Remember**: The weekly review is not optional. It's the heartbeat of GTD.

Without it, the system degrades:
- Inbox grows unchecked
- WAITING items get forgotten
- Projects stall silently
- System trust erodes
- Stress increases

With it, you have:
- Complete confidence nothing is missed
- Clear priorities for next week
- Clean mental state for weekend
- Continuous system improvement
- Reduced anxiety

This is your 45 minutes of weekly system maintenance that enables 40+ hours of productive work.
