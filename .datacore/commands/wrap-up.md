# Session Wrap-Up

Quick session wrap-up before closing a Claude Code conversation.

## Usage

```
/wrap-up
```

**Also triggered by natural language:**
- "wrap up"
- "let's wrap up"
- "it's done"
- "let's close"
- "I'm done"
- "that's it for now"
- "closing up"
- "end session"

**When**: Before closing terminal after a work session
**Duration**: ~2-5 minutes (mostly automated, light interaction)

## Context

You started this conversation with a goal. Work happened, insights emerged. Now you're ready to close this terminal window. This command ensures:
- Incomplete work becomes continuation tasks with context
- Learnings are captured
- Journal is updated
- Completed tasks are marked done

## Sequence

### 1. Session Summary (Automatic)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
SESSION WRAP-UP
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Goal: [Inferred from conversation start or ask user]

Work completed:
  - [List key accomplishments from session]
  - [Files created/modified]
  - [Decisions made]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### 2. Continuation Tasks

**If work is incomplete:**

```
CONTINUATION TASKS
──────────────────
This session's work appears incomplete. Let me capture what's needed to continue.

What remains to be done? (brief, or I'll infer from context)
> [user input or auto-inferred]

Creating continuation task with bootstrap context...
```

**Bootstrap prompt format** (stored in task):

```org
*** TODO Continue: [task description]                    :continuation:
SCHEDULED: <YYYY-MM-DD Day>
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [timestamp]
:SESSION: [today's date + time]
:BOOTSTRAP: |
  Context: [What was being worked on]
  Progress: [What was accomplished]
  Next steps: [Specific next actions]
  Key files: [Relevant file paths]
  Blockers: [Any known blockers]
:END:

[Full bootstrap prompt for next session]

To continue this work, the next session should:
1. [Specific step 1]
2. [Specific step 2]
3. [Specific step 3]

Relevant context:
- [Key insight 1]
- [Key insight 2]
```

**The BOOTSTRAP property enables the next session to:**
- Understand what was happening
- Pick up exactly where this session left off
- Have all necessary context without re-reading files

### 3. Mark Completed Tasks

```
TASK COMPLETION
───────────────
Checking for completed tasks from this session...

[Scan next_actions.org for tasks related to session work]

Found X tasks that appear complete:
- [ ] Task 1 → Mark DONE? [Y/n]
- [ ] Task 2 → Mark DONE? [Y/n]

[Update org-mode states]
```

### 4. Session Learning (Automatic + Light Prompt)

```
SESSION LEARNING
────────────────
Extracting learnings from this session...

Patterns detected:
- [Auto-detected pattern from work done]

Any additional insights to capture? (brief, or Enter to skip)
> [user input]

[If input provided:]
Added to patterns.md: [description]

[If skipped:]
Automatic patterns captured.
```

**What gets captured:**
- Successful approaches used
- New patterns discovered
- Corrections made (to corrections.md)
- Insights worth preserving

### 5. Journal Entry (Automatic)

**Append to today's journal** (`0-personal/notes/journals/YYYY-MM-DD.md`):

```markdown
## Session: HH:MM - [Goal]

**Accomplished:**
- [Key accomplishment 1]
- [Key accomplishment 2]

**Continuation:**
- [Task created if incomplete]

**Learnings:**
- [Patterns/insights captured]

**Files:**
- Created: [list]
- Modified: [list]
```

**If working in a space, also update space journal:**
- `1-datafund/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `2-datacore/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### 6. Push Changes to Repos

**Uses `./sync push` with retry logic (up to 2 retries on failure).**

```
SAVING WORK
───────────
Checking for uncommitted changes...

datacore (root).......... [3 files changed]
  → Committing: "Session: [goal summary]"
  → Pushing... Done

datafund-space........... [No changes]
datacore-space........... [1 file changed]
  → Committing: "Session: [goal summary]"
  → Pushing... Done

All work saved.
```

**Commit message format:**
```
Session: [brief goal/topic]

- [Key change 1]
- [Key change 2]

🤖 Generated with Claude Code
```

**If push fails:**
```
⚠ Push failed for [repo]. Will retry in /tomorrow.
  Error: [error message]
  Your changes are committed locally.
```

### 7. Context Sync (Automatic, Silent)

```
[Check if agents/commands changed during session]
[If changed: backup + update CLAUDE.md tables]
[Log to journal if updates made]
```

### 8. Quick AI Delegation Check (Optional)

```
AI DELEGATION
─────────────
Any quick tasks to delegate to AI? (brief, or Enter to skip)
> [user input]

[If input:]
Added to next_actions.org with :AI: tag.
Will be reviewed in /tomorrow for overnight execution.

[If skipped:]
No new AI tasks.
```

### 9. Close

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
SESSION COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Summary:
- Tasks completed: X
- Continuation tasks: X (with bootstrap context)
- Learnings captured: X patterns
- Journal updated: Yes

[If continuation task created:]
Next session can run: /continue
Or search for :continuation: tagged tasks.

Ready to close terminal.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Key Concepts

### Bootstrap Prompts

When work is incomplete, the continuation task includes a **bootstrap prompt** - a self-contained context block that enables the next session to understand:
- What was the goal
- What progress was made
- What specifically needs to happen next
- What files/context are relevant

This eliminates the "where was I?" problem when resuming work.

### Session vs Day

| Command | Scope | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `/wrap-up` | Session | Close current conversation, capture continuations |
| `/tomorrow` | Day | End of day, AI delegation, priorities for tomorrow |

You can run `/wrap-up` multiple times per day (after each session).
Run `/tomorrow` once at end of day.

### Light vs Full AI Delegation

- `/wrap-up`: Quick capture of obvious AI tasks
- `/tomorrow`: Full review, priority setting, overnight delegation

## Files Referenced

**Read:**
- Conversation context
- `org/next_actions.org` (for completed tasks)
- Today's journal

**Update:**
- `org/next_actions.org` (mark DONE, add continuations)
- `0-personal/notes/journals/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Space journals if applicable
- `.datacore/learning/patterns.md`
- `CLAUDE.md` (if context sync needed)

**Create:**
- Continuation tasks with bootstrap prompts
- Backup in `.datacore/state/` (if context changed)

## Automation Level

| Step | Automation |
|------|------------|
| Session summary | Automatic (inferred from context) |
| Continuation tasks | Semi-auto (user confirms/adds context) |
| Task completion | Semi-auto (user confirms) |
| Learning extraction | Mostly auto (optional user input) |
| Journal entry | Automatic |
| Push to repos | Automatic (commit + push all changes) |
| Context sync | Automatic (silent) |
| AI delegation | Optional (user-initiated) |
