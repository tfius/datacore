# Diagnostic

**"All hands, this is the bridge. Prepare for full systems diagnostic."**

Run a comprehensive diagnostic of all Datacore systems to verify installation health and operational status.

## Behavior

Execute a Level 1 diagnostic sequence, checking all primary and secondary systems. Report status using TNG-style terminology.

## Diagnostic Sequence

### 1. Primary Systems Check

**Core Matrix:**
- Verify `~/Data` exists and is accessible
- Check `.datacore/` directory structure
- Verify CLAUDE.md present at root

**Report format:**
```
PRIMARY SYSTEMS
---------------
Core Matrix.............. [OPERATIONAL/OFFLINE]
  - Root directory: [path]
  - .datacore config: [PRESENT/MISSING]
  - CLAUDE.md: [PRESENT/MISSING]
```

### 2. Repository Health

**Check git status for all repositories:**

| Repository | Location | Expected Remote |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| datacore (root) | `~/Data/` | datacore-one/datacore |
| datafund-space | `~/Data/1-datafund/` | datacore-one/datafund-space |
| datacore-space | `~/Data/2-datacore/` | datacore-one/datacore-space |
| datacore-dips | `~/.datacore/dips/` | datacore-one/datacore-dips |
| trading (module) | `~/.datacore/modules/trading/` | datacore-one/datacore-trading |
| datacore-campaigns (module) | `~/.datacore/modules/datacore-campaigns/` | datacore-one/datacore-campaigns |

**Note:** All modules should be git repos linked to their upstream. Check for `.git` directory in each module.

**For each repo check:**
- Working tree status (clean/dirty)
- Uncommitted changes count
- Untracked files count
- Remote sync status (ahead/behind/up-to-date)

**Report format:**
```
REPOSITORY HEALTH

Core Repos:
  datacore (root).......... [SYNCED/DIRTY/AHEAD/BEHIND]
    - Uncommitted: [count] files
    - Untracked: [count] files

- today.md
- gtd-daily-start.md
- gtd-daily-end.md
- gtd-weekly-review.md
- gtd-monthly-strategic.md
- diagnostic.md (this file)

**Report format:**

```

### 5. Global Infrastructure

**Check `.datacore/` contents:**

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| DIPs | `.datacore/dips/` | Datacore Improvement Proposals |
| Specs | `.datacore/specs/` | System specifications |
| Modules | `.datacore/modules/` | Installed modules |

### 6. Space Diagnostics

**For each space, check DIP-0002 (Layered Context) and DIP-0003 (Scaffolding) compliance.**

**Note:** For detailed DIP-0002 validation (content layer correctness, privacy checks, staleness), invoke the `context-maintainer` agent separately.

#### Personal Space (0-personal/)

**Report format:**
```

### 9. Context Integrity (CLAUDE.md Health)

**Run context-maintainer validation on root CLAUDE.md:**

```
CONTEXT INTEGRITY
-----------------
CLAUDE.md Analysis:
  Line Count............. [N] lines
    - Status: [NOMINAL (<300) / ELEVATED (300-350) / CRITICAL (>350)]

  Agent Registry:

    - Actual files: [N] agents
    - Status: [SYNCHRONIZED / DRIFT DETECTED]

  Command Registry:
    - Documented: [N] commands
    - Actual files: [N] commands
    - Status: [SYNCHRONIZED / DRIFT DETECTED]

  Verification Date:
    - Last verified: [date]
    - Age: [N] days
    - Status: [CURRENT (≤7 days) / STALE (>7 days)]

Context Integrity: [OPTIMAL / MAINTENANCE REQUIRED / CRITICAL]
```

**If issues detected:**
- Drift: "Context registry out of sync. Run context-maintainer to reconcile."
- Line count elevated: "Context file exceeds optimal size. Review for consolidation."
- Stale verification: "Verification date expired. Confirm counts and update."

## Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| OPERATIONAL | Fully functional |
| ONLINE | Available and ready |
| STANDING BY | Agent ready for activation |
| READY | System prepared |
| ACTIVE | Currently engaged |
| PRESENT | File/directory exists |
| SYNCED | Git repo clean and up-to-date with remote |
| DIRTY | Git repo has uncommitted changes |
| AHEAD | Git repo has commits not pushed |
| BEHIND | Git repo needs to pull from remote |
| DEGRADED | Partially functional, some issues |
| OFFLINE | Not available |
| MISSING | Required component not found |
| NOMINAL | Within acceptable parameters |
| ELEVATED | Above optimal, attention recommended |
| SYNCHRONIZED | Registry matches actual files |
| DRIFT DETECTED | Registry differs from actual files |
| CURRENT | Recently verified (≤7 days) |
| STALE | Verification expired (>7 days) |
| OPTIMAL | All context checks passing |
| MAINTENANCE REQUIRED | Context needs attention |

## Usage

Run this command:
- After initial installation
- When something seems wrong
- After significant system changes
- Before committing/pushing changes
- Periodically to verify health

## Output

Display the full diagnostic report in the terminal. Use monospace formatting for alignment.

If critical issues are found, provide specific remediation steps.

## Diagnostic Levels (TNG Reference)

| Level | Scope | Duration | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| Level 1 | Full systems, all subsystems | 10+ min | Post-install, major issues |
| Level 3 | Primary systems only | 3-5 min | Routine check |
| Level 5 | Quick status only | <1 min | Fast verification |

This command runs a **Level 1 diagnostic** by default.
