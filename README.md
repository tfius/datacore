# Datacore

**Your mind, extended.**

Datacore is your second self - an AI extension that learns what you know, handles what drains you, and amplifies what makes you unique.

Not AI that replaces you. AI that extends you.

## What is Datacore?

Datacore is an open-source AI second brain system built on GTD (Getting Things Done) methodology. It creates extensions of yourself through AI agents aligned to your knowledge, goals, and workflows.

- **Knowledge-centered**: Your expertise becomes leverage
- **Autonomous operations**: Systems that work while you rest
- **Human-first**: Technology serving human flourishing

## Built-in Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ai-task-executor` | Routes :AI: tagged tasks to specialized agents |
| `gtd-inbox-processor` | Processes inbox entries with GTD methodology |
| `gtd-content-writer` | Generates blog posts, emails, documentation |
| `gtd-data-analyzer` | Creates reports, metrics, insights |
| `gtd-project-manager` | Tracks projects, escalates blockers |
| `gtd-research-processor` | Analyzes URLs, creates literature notes |
| `conversation-processor` | Extracts knowledge from ChatGPT exports |
| `research-link-processor` | Batch URL processing |
| `archiver` | Manages content archival with version linking |

## Built-in Commands

**GTD Workflow:**
- `/gtd-daily-start` - Morning planning with AI work review
- `/gtd-daily-end` - Evening wrap-up and AI delegation
- `/gtd-weekly-review` - Comprehensive weekly review
- `/gtd-monthly-strategic` - Monthly planning and goal setting
- `/today` - Generate daily briefing

## How It Works

```
1. Capture everything to inbox.org
           ↓
2. /gtd-daily-end processes inbox, delegates :AI: tasks
           ↓
3. AI agents execute overnight (research, content, analysis)
           ↓
4. /gtd-daily-start reviews completed AI work
           ↓
5. You focus on what matters
```

**AI Task Delegation:**
```org
* TODO Research market trends for Q1 :AI:research:
* TODO Draft blog post about productivity :AI:content:
* TODO Generate weekly metrics report :AI:data:
* TODO Track project milestones :AI:pm:
```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone to ~/Data
git clone https://github.com/datacore-one/datacore.git ~/Data

# Create your configuration
cp ~/Data/install.yaml.example ~/Data/install.yaml
cp ~/Data/CLAUDE.template.md ~/Data/CLAUDE.md

# Edit install.yaml and CLAUDE.md with your details
```

## Optional Modules

Extend functionality by installing modules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datacore-one/datacore-trading .datacore/modules/trading
```

Modules add specialized agents and commands for specific domains.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) - AI coding assistant
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with org-mode (for GTD)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) (for PKM)

## Philosophy

> *"Live long and prosper."*

Datacore is built on the belief that technology should serve human flourishing, not demand sacrifice. Your knowledge becomes leverage. Your expertise works while you rest. One person with Datacore has the capabilities of many.

**Core principles:**
- Augment, don't replace - AI assists, humans decide
- Knowledge is leverage - your expertise as an asset
- Single capture point - inbox.org, then route and clear
- Progressive processing - inbox to action to knowledge to archive
